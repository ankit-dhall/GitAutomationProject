# Git Automation For WSL

## Introduction

I wanted to create a Git Automation script for personal use which is inspired from some YouTube videos that I saw around this.
My twist to this thing is to implement this in WSL as I'm enthusiastically learning Linux but having a Windows laptop (X1 Carbon) and the introduction of WSL has made me not to switch to Linux but still use it nicely.

## Guide
Add .my_bash_commands.sh to .bashrc for the function **gitcreate** to be accessible from anywhere in shell

### Command Format
`gitcreate <Repo-Name> <Git-User-Name> <Git-Passoword>`
